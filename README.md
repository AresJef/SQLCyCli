## Fast MySQL driver build in Cython (Sync and Async).

Created to be used in a project, this package is published to github for ease of management and installation across different modules.

### Installation

Install from `PyPi`

```bash
pip install sqlcycli
```

Install from `github`

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AresJef/SQLCyCli.git
```

For Linux systems, if you encounter the following error when installing the SQLCyCli dependency [mysqlclient](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient):

```
Exception: Can not find valid pkg-config name.
Specify MYSQLCLIENT_CFLAGS and MYSQLCLIENT_LDFLAGS env vars manually
```

Try the following to fix dependency issue (source: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76585758/mysqlclient-cannot-install-via-pip-cannot-find-pkg-config-name-in-ubuntu)):

```bash
sudo apt-get install pkg-config python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essential
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher.
- MySQL 5.5 or higher.

### Features

- Written in [Cython](https://cython.org/) for optimal performance (especially for SELECT/INSERT query).
- All classes and methods are well documented and type annotated.
- Supports both `Sync` and `Async` connection to the server.
- API Compatiable with [PyMySQL](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL) and [aiomysql](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomysql).
- Support conversion (escape) for most of the native python types, and objects from libaray [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas). Does `NOT` support custom conversion (escape).

### Usage

#### Use `connect()` to create one connection (`Sync` or `Async`) to the server.

```python
import asyncio
import sqlcycli

HOST = "localhost"
PORT = 3306
USER = "root"
PSWD = "password"

# Synchronous Connection
def test_sync_connection() -> None:
    with sqlcycli.connect(HOST, PORT, USER, PSWD) as conn:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute("SELECT 1")
            res = cur.fetchone()
            assert res == (1,)
    # Connection closed
    assert conn.closed()

# Asynchronous Connection
async def test_async_connection() -> None:
    async with sqlcycli.connect(HOST, PORT, USER, PSWD) as conn:
        async with conn.cursor() as cur:
            await cur.execute("SELECT 1")
            res = await cur.fetchone()
            assert res == (1,)
    # Connection closed
    assert conn.closed()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_sync_connection()
    asyncio.run(test_async_connection())
```

#### Use `create_pool()` to create a Pool for managing and maintaining `Async` connections to the server.

```python
import asyncio
import sqlcycli

HOST = "localhost"
PORT = 3306
USER = "root"
PSWD = "password"

# Pool (Context Manager: Connected)
async def test_pool_context_connected() -> None:
    async with sqlcycli.create_pool(HOST, PORT, USER, PSWD, min_size=1) as pool:
        # Pool is connected: 1 free connection (min_size=1)
        assert not pool.closed() and pool.free == 1
        async with pool.acquire() as conn:
            async with conn.cursor() as cur:
                await cur.execute("SELECT 1")
                res = await cur.fetchone()
                assert res == (1,)
    # Pool closed
    assert pool.closed() and pool.total == 0

# Pool (Context Manager: Disconnected)
async def test_pool_context_disconnected() -> None:
    with sqlcycli.create_pool(HOST, PORT, USER, PSWD, min_size=1) as pool:
        # Pool is not connected: 0 free connection (min_size=1)
        assert pool.closed() and pool.free == 0
        # Connect automatically
        async with pool.acquire() as conn:
            async with conn.cursor() as cur:
                await cur.execute("SELECT 1")
                res = await cur.fetchone()
                assert res == (1,)
        # 1 free connection
        assert pool.free == 1
    # Pool closed
    assert pool.closed() and pool.total == 0

# Pool (Create Directly: Connected)
async def test_pool_direct_connected() -> None:
    pool = await sqlcycli.create_pool(HOST, PORT, USER, PSWD, min_size=1)
    # Pool is connected: 1 free connection (min_size=1)
    assert not pool.closed() and pool.free == 1
    async with pool.acquire() as conn:
        async with conn.cursor() as cur:
            await cur.execute("SELECT 1")
            res = await cur.fetchone()
            assert res == (1,)
    # Close pool manually
    await pool.close()
    assert pool.closed() and pool.total == 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_pool_context_connected())
    asyncio.run(test_pool_context_disconnected())
    asyncio.run(test_pool_direct_connected())
```
